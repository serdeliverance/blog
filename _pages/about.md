Fullstack Engineer stronger on backend. Most of my experience is based on JVM related technologies (Scala and Java). I'm a problem solver in general, but Scala lover in particular. The aim of this blog is to put thoughts about software development (Microservices, Architecture, programming languages and tools), maybe putting some emphasis in Scala from time to time.

My geek interests are Functional Programming and Distributed Systems.

Also, I'm a Systems Engineer graduated from Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional with a postgraduate in Business Intelligence.
