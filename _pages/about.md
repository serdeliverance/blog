I define myself as a Fullstack Engineer that loves solving problems and delivering high quality software with a strong commitment to continuous improvement. I've been working with microservices architecture, CI/CD and containers. By the moment, most of my experience is about Java related technologies. I'm always pleased to learn new technologies and being challenged in the meantime. Nowadays, I'm having fun learning functional programming with Scala, diving into its awesome ecosystem and working on side projects.
