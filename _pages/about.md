Fullstack Engineer stronger on backend. The aim of this blog is to share knowledge about Microservices, Tech Stacks (with special emphasis in JVM related ones and maybe some Node/React) and Software Engineering in general.

Also, I'm a Systems Engineer graduated from Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional with a postgraduate in Business Intelligence.
