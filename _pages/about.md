I'm a Fullstack engineer that enjoy solving problems and learning new stuff. Most of my experience is based on JVM related technologies (such as Java/Spring or Scala/Akka/Play). I sometimes do some `Node` stuff and some front end with `React`. In the last couple of years, I became a `Scala` lover, being it my favourite programming language. However, I keep myself technology agnostic, business focused and loyal to my mantra: `always use the right tool for the job and being as pragmatic as possible`.

Nowadays, I’m mainly interested in `Reactive Streams`, `Distributed Systems` and `Functional Programming`.

Also, I'm a Systems Engineer graduated from Universidad Tecnológica Nacional with a postgraduate in Business Intelligence.
