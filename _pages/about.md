Seasoned Fullstack Engineer with strong backend skills. Most of my experience is based on JVM related technologies (Scala, Java and Kotlin). Also, I love the Javascript ecosystem (mainly Nodejs, Nextjs and React). My approach is to always use the right tool for the job and being as pragmatic as possible.

My geek interests are Functional Programming, Reactive Programming and Distributed Systems.

Also, I'm a Systems Engineer graduated from Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional with a postgraduate in Business Intelligence.
