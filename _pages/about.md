Fullstack engineer that love solving problems and learning new things. Most of my experience is based on JVM related technologies (such as Java/Spring or Scala/Akka/Play), but I sometimes do some front end stuff (Angular/React).

I'm very interested in functional programming and concurrency. Because of that, I'm having fun trying to incorporate some reactive streams and functional programming ideas when solving problems wherever them make sense to the business.

Also, I'm a Systems Engineer graduated from Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional with a postgraduate in Business Intelligence.
