I'm a Fullstack engineer that enjoy solving problems and learning new stuff. Most of my experience is based on JVM related technologies (such as Java/Spring or Scala/Akka/Play). I sometimes do some front end stuff with React.

Nowadays, I’m mainly interested in functional programming and concurrency. Because of that, I always try to incorporate some reactive streams and functional programming ideas when solving problems to deliver value to the business.

Also, I'm a Systems Engineer graduated from Universidad Tecnológica Nacional with a postgraduate in Business Intelligence.
