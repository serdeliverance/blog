## Intro

It's been more than a year since I started using Scala. So, I think it's a good time to review my journey and share my thoughts about this awesome language and its ecosystem.

## My journey

My first contact with Scala was through the book `Functional Programming in Scala` (aka `The Red Book`). With that book I learned some functional programming ideas and basic Scala syntax. I must confess that reading it was very challenging for me. The exercises were difficult and make you thinking over them for a while until comming with the solution (If you could).

However, at some point of the reading I thought that It was over complicated and I started considering learning from another source. So, I came out with some Akka related Udemy courses. I had a great experience learning Akka basics, some Akka Persistence stuff, but learning Akka Streams simply blowed my mind. Writing async pipelines were awesome and I felt in love with Stream processing, in general, and Akka Streams and Alpakka, in particular.

After that, I got my first job as a Scala developer, and I started learning more about `Play Framework` and I had my first contact with `Typelevel libraries`, such as `Cats` and `Circe`.

In my free time I continued reading some books. I read `Scala Essentials`, `Scala with Cats` and I've tried to develop some applications using just the `Typelevel stack` (`Cats`, `Http4s`, `Doobie`, etc) but I've never succeeded. Until now I still think that `Typelevel` ecosystem is very challenging and over complicated. I will not deny that the way of reasoning about effects and developing an app just with pure functions is very interesting and that has its benefits (for example, in testing), but I think the learning curve is very sharp and I don't know if it's really worth it. However, something is true: I'll continue playing around with it. I know that at some point it will make more sense to me.

Enough talking about myself, let's review some points about the Scala language and it's ecosystem.

## Language

## Community

## Tooling

## Frameworks and Libraries

## Conclusions

Nowadays, I continue learning from conferences, reading tutorials and I have some books on my list of future readings (`Practical Functional in Scala`, `FP for mortals`, `Effects in Scala` and `Hands on Scala`). Additionally, I wan't to give some libraries and tools a try, such as `Quill`, `Finagle Finch`, `Upickle`, `Greyhound`, `Ammonite`, `Request`, `FS2` and `Zio`.
