# Intro

In this review we are going to talk about the awesome book [Get Your Hands Dirty with Clean Architecture]() by `Tom Hombergs`

# Who is audience of this book?

I think this book is great for any software developer, architect or tech lead involved in the creation of software which handles complex business rules wich a high expectation of change and adaptability over the time.

# The author

`TODO`

# Review

The books starts explaining the disadvantages of the traditional and well known `Layered Architecture`. It explains how this architecture is persistence oriented, how easy is to mix layers and loose discipline and how prone to mantainability issues is.

Then, the author explains why `Single Resposibility Principle` and the `Dependency Inversion Principle` (yes, the `S` and `D` you know from `SOLID`) are important in our jorney towards `Hexagonal Architecture`. Also, he explains `package organization`, which is something really important not just to organize our code, but to express our architecture intentions.

# Conclusion
