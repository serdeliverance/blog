# Intro

In this review we are going to talk about the awesome book [Get Your Hands Dirty with Clean Architecture]() by `Tom Hombergs`

# Who is audience of this book?

I think this book is great for any software developer, architect or tech lead involved in the creation of software which handles complex business rules wich a high expectation of change and adaptability over the time.

# The author

`TODO`

# Review

The books starts explaining the disadvantages of the traditional and well known `Layered Architecture`. It explains how this architecture is persistence oriented, how easy is to mix layers and loose discipline and how prone to mantainability issues is.

Then, the author explains why `Single Resposibility Principle` and the `Dependency Inversion Principle` (yes, the `S` and `D` you know from `SOLID`) are important in our jorney towards `Hexagonal Architecture`. Also, he explains `package organization`, which is something really important not just to organize our code, but to express our architecture intentions.

# How to take the most of this book

As I said before, the book has a really practical approach. I recommend coding the `buckpal` application together with the author. Also, I suggest to take a pet project you have and refactoring it using the ideas seen in the book. Following those tips you'll find yourself adopting this approach very quickly and getting the benefits of this interesting architecture.

As a theoric complement, I strongly recommend watching the talk [Clean Architecture with Spring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPH5AiqLQTo) by the same author, and reading the post [Hexagonal Architecture](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/) by `Alistair Cockburn`, the creator of this architectural style.
