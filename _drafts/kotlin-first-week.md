## Intro

Some weeks ago, I decided to take a rest from `Scala` for a lot of reasons (new Scala 3 adoptions is very difficult because of libraries support, tooling, compiler, the community in general). Also, I'm next to start a new job in a company that is leaving `Scala`. So, I'll start thinking in new technologies to learn. I felt in love with `Nodejs` and `Javascript`. I think the user experience is great. However, I missed the `JVM`, so I decided to give `Kotlin` another chance.

After watching [this awesome talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1RVYt2QKQE&t=328s), I decided to start learning it through katas and real world projects. So, thats what I during my first week using it.
